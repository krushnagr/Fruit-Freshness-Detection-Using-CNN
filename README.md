# Fruit-Freshness-Detection-Using-CNN
Quality of fruits and vegetables are most important as these are the main ingredients for our health. Freshness of fruits and vegetables are most important but segregation of rotten and fresh is time consuming, when done manually and degrades quality of fruits. Application based on Computer vision and image processing reduces this tedious and focuses on the quality of fruit and vegetable detection for a long period of time. The proposed method uses CNN to analyze and detect the variation and pattern for accurate classification.The work recommends a semantic segmentation of fresh or the rotten portion observed in any fruit. It is entirely based on the RGB image of the fruit.
